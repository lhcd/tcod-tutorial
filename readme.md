a relatively close follow of [this tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/) with mostly QoL and stylistic changes (typehinting/breaking up some monoliths/auto formatting/etc) & updates for compatibility with changes in tcod

if you somehow found this repo and want to learn tcod, there's a [new version](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/) that appears to be more up to date
